## Individual Reflections

### Efthymios Christodoulakis

#### Learning Experience
At the beginning of the course, I had no prior experience with Python or BIM-specific tools like `ifcopenshell`. I started at **Learning Level 1**, focusing on basic understanding and code comprehension. By the end, I reached a better level, successfully applying Python scripting for IFC data extraction and property analysis.

#### Key Learning Highlights
- **IFC Analysis:** Learned how to navigate IFC files using Python scripting.
- **CO2 Footprint Analysis:** Applied custom scripts to calculate concrete volumes and estimate environmental impacts.
- **Process Development:** Contributed to a tutorial that helps to understand complex concepts into user-friendly workflows.

#### Future Goals
- Continue advancing Python skills, particularly focusing on OpenBIM tools like `ifcopenshell`.

#### Using OpenBIM in the Future
- **Academic Work:** Not considering OpenBIM tools for thesis work due to limited Python knowledge.
- **Professional Life:** Likely to invest more time in OpenBIM tools to stay relevant in sustainability-focused roles.

### Frederikke Secher Mosbech

#### Learning Experience
I started this course at **Learning Level 1**, with no coding background. Through this course, I learned the basics of using Python and `ifcopenshell` to analyze models.

#### Key Learning Highlights
- **Geometry and Data Extraction:** Learned intermediate-level scripting for extracting dimensions and properties from IFC files. Became aware of the potential of Blender for future use and script improvement.
- **Collaboration:** Improved ability to work in a technical team, adapting to feedback to refine our tool and tutorial.

#### Future Goals
- Deepen Python expertise and improve automation skills for broader applications. Specifically:
  - Improve the script to handle multiple materials and elements.
  - Simplify functionality so it can work on various models without predefined elements or material names.
- Create a generalized script usable across different models.

#### Using OpenBIM in the Future
- **Academic Work:** OpenBIM tools might not be relevant for my thesis, but I would use them for model analysis if needed.
- **Professional Life:** See potential in using OpenBIM for improving workflows and saving time on data collection and analysis from BIM files. This type of tool could be valuable in early design stages, especially in urban planning, such as helping municipalities assess building heights, footprints, or basement inclusion.

## Group Summary of Feedback

### Strengths:
- Clear presentation with visual aids like step diagrams and flowcharts.
- Valuable addition of GFA calculation alongside CO2 footprint estimation.
- Tool deemed useful for early-stage sustainability assessments.

### Areas for Improvement:
- Expand material types for broader applicability.
- Explore API integrations for enhanced automation.

### Did the Tool Address the Use Case Identified?
Initially, the script aimed to validate the CO2 footprint claim from the client report. Ultimately, we developed a partial tool that can make a rough approximation of CO2 emissions for materials. With further evolution, this tool can become highly useful during early design stages of future projects.

## Wrap-Up of Assignments

### **A1: Validation of Claims**
- Gained insights into claim validation using BIM data, focusing on environmental impact metrics.

### **A2: Use Case Definition**
- Scoped a CO2 analysis tool focusing on concrete volumes from IFC files.
- Defined workflows and created a BPMN diagram for clarity.

### **A3: Tool Development**
- Developed a functional Python script to estimate CO2 footprints. Limited to concrete but provided a foundation for future expansion.

### **A4: Tutorial Creation**
- Designed a user tutorial to guide peers through our toolâ€™s functionality and its purpose.

## Conclusion
This course has been an invaluable introduction to OpenBIM and Python scripting. The assignments built progressively, enabling a deeper understanding of how BIM tools can support sustainable design. While we achieved significant milestones, there is much more to learn. This journey has equipped us with the skills and motivation to continue exploring the intersection of sustainability and digital design tools.
