Learning Experience
At the beginning of the course, I had no prior experience with Python or BIM-specific tools like ifcopenshell. I started at Learning Level 1, focusing on basic understanding and code comprehension. By the end, I reached a better level, successfully applying Python scripting for IFC data extraction and property analysis.
Key Learning Highlights
•	IFC Analysis: Learned how to navigate IFC files using Python scripting.
•	CO2 Footprint Analysis: Applied custom scripts to calculate concrete volumes and estimate environmental impacts.
•	Process Development: Contributed to a tutorial that helps to understand complex concepts into user-friendly workflows.
Future Goals
•	Continue advancing Python skills, particularly focusing on OpenBIM tools like ifcopenshell.
Using OpenBIM in the Future
•	Academic Work: Not really considering OpenBIM tools for thesis, especially to address sustainability in building design because of the lack of my PYTHON knowledge.
•	Professional Life: Likely to invest more time in OpenBIM tools to stay relevant in sustainability-focused roles.

Learning Experience
I started this course at Learning Level 1, with no coding background. Through this course I learned the basics of using Python and ifcopenshell to analyze models. 
Key Learning Highlights
•	Geometry and Data Extraction: learned intermediate-level scripting for extracting dimensions and properties from IFC files and became aware of the potential of blender for future use and improvement of the current script.
•	Collaboration: Improved ability to work in a technical team, adapting to feedback to refine our tool and tutorial.
Future Goals
•	Deepen Python expertise and improve automation skills for broader applications. For this script in particular I would like it to be improved to include multiple materials and elements and simplify it so it does not have to include all elements in the script, but maybe a function that works on all elements. The same goes for materials, where it should be able to find the material associated with the element under material association instead of in the name.
•	Make a script that is more general to be used in more models than this one and still function.
Using OpenBIM in the Future
•	Academic Work: I don’t think it would be relevant for my thesis, but if I need to do any model analysis I would definitely use OpenBIM.
•	Professional Life: I see a potential in using OpenBIM in my professional life for improving work flow and save time on data collection and analysis from BIM files. I plan on working in urban planning and think this type of tool (if improved and expanded) could be useful as a tool in the early design stages. Especially used by municipalities when deciding heights and footprints of buildings or to include basements or not. 



Group Summary of Feedback
•	Strengths:
o	Clear presentation with visual aids like step diagrams and flowcharts.
o	Valuable addition of GFA calculation alongside CO2 footprint estimation.
o	Tool deemed useful for early-stage sustainability assessments.
•	Areas for Improvement:
o	Expand material types for broader applicability.
o	Explore API integrations for enhanced automation.
•	Did the tool address the use case you identified?
o	In the beginning of this script we wanted to create something that would test the claim they made for the carbon footprint in the report. In the end we created part of a tool that can make a rough approximation of the CO2 emissions for materials. Thus, a possible evolution of our  tool can be really useful in the early design stages in future projects.  

Wrap-Up of Assignments
A1: Validation of Claims
•	Gained insights into claim validation using BIM data, focusing on environmental impact metrics.
A2: Use Case Definition
•	Scoped a CO2 analysis tool focusing on concrete volumes from IFC files. Defined workflows and created a BPMN diagram for clarity.
A3: Tool Development
•	Developed a functional Python script to estimate CO2 footprints. Limited to concrete but provided a foundation for future expansion.
A4: Tutorial Creation
•	Designed a user tutorial to guide peers through our tool’s functionality and its purpose.

Conclusion
This course has been an invaluable introduction to OpenBIM and Python scripting. The assignments built progressively, enabling a deeper understanding of how BIM tools can support sustainable design. While we achieved significant milestones, there is much more to learn. This journey has equipped us with the skills and motivation to continue exploring the intersection of sustainability and digital design tools.
